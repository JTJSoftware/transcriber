 Theory of operation:
The purpose of Audio Transcriber/Recorder is to record large audio streams to a hard disk and then to split that file into smaller samples suitable for burning to cdr media and to burn a cdr, cdrw.
An audio source connected to your sound card(/dev/dsp) supplies an audio stream that is recorded to your harddrive. This audio source could be a radio, tape player, microphone or whatever. This large sample can then be  broken down into smaller samples in a suitable format to be burned onto recordable cd media. I want a minimum of effort on my part to do all of this. The basic functionality is:
  Record an audio stream to a harddisk.
  Split a large audio file on the harddisk into small audio files.
  Record audio file(s) onto cdr or cdrw disk
  Maximum configurability if wanted, but defaults are correct 99.99 percent of the time.
Audio Transcriber/Recorder is basically a frontend to SOX, CDRECORD, CDDA2WAV. It implements only a subset of these packages functionality in it's interface. You may use more of the functionality of these packages from within this program by editing their "control strings".
The gui uses a tabbed/notebook style to keep the interface as clean as possible. Bubble help pops up to clarify the interface where needed when the mouse hoovers over a control.
