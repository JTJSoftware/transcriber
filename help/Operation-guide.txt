 General Operation guidelines:
The program is best started from a terminal window (/path-to/recorder.pl) so that the output from the various programs it calls can be viewed. In other words the programs output messages are sent to stdout. This is helpful because you can see whats going on behind the gui interface. The messages in the term window are your only clue if there is an error in one of the progams, Sox, CDrecord, CDDA2WAV, that it starts(i.e. sox error /dev/dsp busy) - watch the term window!
A little practice with the trim buttons will be very helpfull. You can make your trims as you record the original sample, then go to the Trim/Play Sample tab and fine tune the trims if needed(that's what I do).
Turn off sound events in your window manager if you get alot of /dev/dsp busy errors. I have this problem on my RH7.1 gnome/enlightenment system.
Uh - How do I get the sound into my sound card from my tape deck, radio, whatever? You can buy a cable that plugs in to the audio-out on your sound device(radio, tapedeck) and plugs into your soundcards audio-in plug, I bought one at radio shack for about $5.00. The audio-out on my radio/tapedeck is the headphones plug. Don't forget to bring up your audio mixer and enable the audio-in (or line-in). If you can play a sound through your computer speakers you can record it - plain and simple.
