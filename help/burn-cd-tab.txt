The Burn CD tab contains the controls to burn a cd or blank a cdrw. There is a simple clock at the top of the tab to give a reference to the amount of time elapsed(kinda). Enter, in the File string to Burn field, the name of the file you want to burn to cd. The file name should be the full  pathname of the file, i.e. /cdimage/testa.cdr or /cdimage/*.cdr (which will write all files in the directory ending with .cdr). You should enter any other nesessary parameters in the File string to Burn field, i.e. -pad -audio /cdimage/testa01.cdr /cdimage/testa02.cdr /cdimage/testa03.cdr .... /cdimage/test110.cdr. When you have your file string to burn field filled in press the Burn CD NOW button to burn the cd media. Please read the cdrecord man page for full understanding of the parameters that may be entered in the File string to Burn field.
At the bottom of the screen there is a Blank RW Disk button pressing this button will completely erase a cdrw disk.
If you use the /*.cdr type of format in your File to Burn field don't forget to rename the original sample name to something like 'testa.cdr.bak' so that you don't try to burn all those trimmed samples and the original sample, unless thats what you want to do.
