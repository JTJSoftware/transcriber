<h1>Audio Transcriber/Recorder</h1>
<div align="Left"><br>
<i>Audio Transcriber/Recorder is a perl/Tk program designed to transfer audio
       tapes and lp's to cd's. The target platform is gnu/linux with X windows
and has not   been     tested on other systems</i>.<i><br>
</i>
<hr width="100%" size="2" align="Left"><i><br>
                   Requirements:<br>
</i>
<ul>
  <li>1.5gig harddisk space. A typical cd takes 650 meg of data. If you record 
         a 60 minute cassette tape, or radio broadcast, or whatever to your 
  harddrive       and then want to split it into individual tracks, you will 
  need alot  of   hd  space.</li>
  <li>A directory named /cdimage. Well this is not really a must but it's 
         the default, so please make this directory some place in your directory 
      tree   that has 1.5gig of space. I prefer a dedicated partition.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Perl - with the Tk800.xxx and Tk-Month packages. You'll probably need to go to www.cpan.org 
         to get and install the Tk8 and Tk-Month packages or use MCPAN.</li>
  <li>SOX - sound tools. Comes with most popular linux distros. Please use 
         the SOX-12.17.1-t.tar that is distributed with this software because 
    the    trim functions in earlier versions of sox do not work correctly. 
  SOX  can   be obtained at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">http://www.sourceforge.net</a>
. I have not tested other versions of SOX except the version supplied with
this software.     </li>
  <li>CDrecord. Comes with most linux distros. CDrecord can be obtained at
      <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">http://www.freshmeat.net</a>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>CDDA2WAV. Comes with most linux distros as a part of the cdrecord package. 
         Cdrecord can be obtained at <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net">http://www.freshmeat.net</a>
  </li>
  <li>GNU/Linux. Of course! Is there any other <i>usable</i> OS? Also Xwindows
and the window manager of your choice.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
                 Sox, Cdrecord, cdda2wav must be in your path (i.e. in an 
xterm    you   can   type  <i>sox</i> or <i>cdrecord</i> or <i>cdda2wav</i>
  to invoke    the   respective    program). You must have the propper permissions
set to use the various programs and files used by Audio Transcriber.<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2" align="Left">
<h3><i>Theory of operation:</i></h3>
<h3></h3>
<i>The purpose of Audio Transcriber/Recorder is to record large audio   
      streams to a hard disk and then to split that file into smaller samples
       suitable  for burning to cdr media and to burn a cdr, cdrw. </i><br>
<br>
                   An audio source connected to your sound card(/dev/dsp) 
supplies     an  audio    stream that is recorded to your harddrive. This 
audio source     could  be a  radio,  tape player, microphone or whatever. 
This large sample     can then be  broken  down into smaller samples in a 
suitable format to  be   burned onto recordable  cd media. I want a minimum 
of effort on my part   to  do all of this. The basic  functionality is:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Record an audio stream to a harddisk.</li>
  <li>Split a large audio file on the harddisk into small audio files.</li>
  <li>Record audio file(s) onto cdr or cdrw disk</li>
  <li>Maximum configurability if wanted, but defaults are correct 99.99 percent 
         of the time.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
                   Audio Transcriber/Recorder is basically a frontend to
SOX,   CDRECORD,      CDDA2WAV.   It implements only a subset of these packages 
 functionality   in it's   interface.  You may use more  of the functionality 
 of these packages   from   within this  program by editing  their "control 
 strings". <br>
<br>
                   The gui uses a tabbed/notebook style to keep the interface 
  as  clean    as  possible. Bubble help pops up to clarify the interface 
where   needed  when  the mouse hoovers over a control. In the screenshot 
below bubblehelp  is popped up over the control string field.<br>

      <ul>
        <li>The program is best started from a terminal window ( /path-to/recorder.pl)
  so that the output from the various programs it calls can be viewed. In
other  words the programs output messages are sent to stdout. This is helpful
because  you can see whats going on behind the gui interface. The messages
in the term window are your only clue if there is an error in one of the
progams, Sox, CDrecord, CDDA2WAV, that it starts(i.e. sox error /dev/dsp
busy) - watch the term window!</li>
        <li>A little practice with the trim buttons will be very helpfull.
  You can make your trims as you record the original sample, then go to the
  Trim/Play Sample tab and fine tune the trims if needed(that's what I do).</li>
        <li>Turn off sound events in your window manager if you get alot
of /dev/dsp busy errors. I have this problem on my RH7.1 gnome/enlightenment
  system.</li>
        <li>Uh - How do I get the sound into my sound card from my tape deck,
  radio, whatever? You can buy a cable that plugs in to the audio-out on
your   sound device(radio, tapedeck) and plugs into your soundcards audio-in
plug,   I bought one at radio shack for about $5.00. The audio-out on my
radio/tapedeck   is the headphones plug.&nbsp; Don't forget to bring up your
audio mixer and  enable the audio-in (or line-in). If you can play a sound
through your computer  speakers you can record it - plain and simple.<br>

         The <b>Record</b> tab has controls to record the incomming audio 
stream    to   a  harddrive.  Once a stream is being recorded the trim buttons 
become    activated.    The trim  buttons allow you to build a list of trim 
start==length    pairs  that  you can  use to auto-magicaly trim out samples 
when you are    done recording    by pressing  the "Auto-Magicaly Trim" button. 
When you   automagicaly trim   a recording the  new samples are named as the
original   recording with         <i>     0n</i>  appended (i.e.  testa01.cdr, 
testa02.cdr   .... testa09.cdr, testa110.cdr).    Under this scheme  you can
mark your  trim samples as you record the original. Just press the Trim Start
button  to start the trim and press the Set Length button to set the trim
length.  When the Set Length button is pressed the count list will be updated.
  Then  when you finish recording press the auto-magicaly trim button and
youre   done, the new samples will be added to the directory specified in
the control  string and the original sample will be renamed with .BAK appended
to the name.   </td>
